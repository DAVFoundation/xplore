## What is this project?
DAV (Decentralized Autonomous Vehicles) is a new non-profit foundation working to build an open-source infrastructure for autonomous vehicles (cars, drones, trucks, robots, and all the service providers around them) to communicate and transact with each other over blockchain.

As an organization that believes in building a large community of open-source contributors, we often create issues like this one to help people take their first few steps into the world of open source.

### Xplore
The DAV project you are looking at is Xplore. Xplore is a blockchain explorer you can run on your machine to explore local Ethereum nodes on your machine. It is used by developers working with DAV's libraries to ease development and see how the blockchain is affected by their work.
